Run the server:
sudo ./tlsserver

Assign IP to VPN SERVER TUN Device:
sudo ifconfig tun0 192.168.53.1/24 up

Enable ip forwarding:
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Run the client:
First change the SERVER_IP in tlsclient.c to match with the server's ip.
sudo ./tlsclient ekalirvpnlab.com 4433

Note:
You also need to configure the TUN interface server side, client side is configured automatically and set up routings. See the lab description for instructions.
